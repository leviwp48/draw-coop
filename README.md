## What is draw-coop                                   
draw-coop is a coop drawing experience using socket.io that allows you and up to 4 friends create beautiful (or not so much) art. 

## What can it do
You can create an account now and start drawing on your very own canvas. Friends can hop in through the canvas list and start drawing at the SAME TIME. At the moment only drawing is available and I hope to add other tools in the future.

## What is it for
I had the idea for this project because of the pandemic and the need for ways to connect. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to send them to my email that you can find on the bottom right of the website :)
