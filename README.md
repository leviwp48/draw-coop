### Drawing 
After creating a board or selecting one from the board list, you can now draw on the board. If anyone else has joined your board, they can draw together with you
// insert image here 

You can create an account now and start drawing on your very own canvas. Friends can hop in through the canvas list and start drawing at the SAME TIME. At the moment only drawing is available and I hope to add other tools in the future.
